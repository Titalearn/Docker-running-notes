Docker Image: --> It's a package which contains
                 everything (Libraries, Softwares+ENV+Application Code)
                 needed to run your application.
                 appCode + dependencies[Libraries, Softwares+ENV+]

Docker containers: Run time instance of a docker image. 
     If you execute: docker run, 
     a container is created from the image 

IQ: How many environment are you supporting in your CURRENT role??
         Development environment    
         Testing/QA environment    
         Production environment 
In docker applications run as containers

docker build -t tesla:1 .  
docker run --name tesla -d -p 8000:8080 tesla:1      

 curl 35.92.218.3:8000/webapp     

docker run --name containerName -d -p hostPort:containerPort image:tag 
  -d = detachable mode  
  -p = port Forwarding 

docker run --name hello -d -p 80:80 mylandmarktech/hello 
  curl 35.92.218.3:80  
  docker ps 


DEploying AN Application With an Imageyou don't have
====================================================
docker run --name hello -d -p 80:80 mylandmarktech/hello 
-we do not have these image
-it is going to pull the image from an image registry
-Curl the application on port 80 to make sure its runing
e.g 34.92.218.3:80


docker ps = These shows you application running
docker images = This shows the images you have
docker run = Deploys the application
docker push = Its used to ship images to registries

We can create Registry in Dockerhub,amazonEcr,Nexus,Jfrog
In docker we can divide our environments to dev/prod/Uat
we can build an image in the dev environment and push it to dockerhub.
we pull the image from docker hub to the prod environment and use the image to deploy the application.

DOCKER ENGINE
==============
Consist of docker Cli
consist of docker Daemon
